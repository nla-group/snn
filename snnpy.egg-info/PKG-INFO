SNN is a fast and exact fixed-radius nearest neighbor search algorithm [1]. It uses the first principal component of the data to prune the search space and speeds up Euclidean distance computations using high-level BLAS routines. SNN is implemented in native Python. On many problems, SNN is faster than KDtree and Balltree in the scikit-learn package. There is also a C++ implementation of SNN. 

### Reproducibility

To reproduce the experiments from the paper [1], see the instructions and code in the `exp` subfolder.

### Python installation

The native Python implementation of SNN can be installed by:

```sh
pip install snnpy
```

### Python API

Here is an example illustrating the use of SNN:

```python
import numpy as np
from snnpy import *
from time import time

n_samples = 100000
n_dim =  100
radius = 3.5
rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
X = rng.random_sample((n_samples, n_dim))  

# build SNN model
st = time()
snn_model = build_snn_model(X)  
print("SNN index time:", time()-st)
# will be faster if return_dist is False, then no distance information come out

# query neighbors of X[0]
st = time()
ind,dist = snn_model.query_radius(X[0], radius, return_distance=True)
# If remove the returning of the associated distance, use: ind, dist = snn_model.query_radius(X[0], radius, return_distance=False)
sort_ind = np.argsort(dist)
print("SNN query time:", time()-st)

# print total number and top five indices
print("number of neighbors:", len(ind))
print("indices of closest five:", ", ".join([str(i) for i in ind[sort_ind][:5]]))

# EXAMPLE OUTPUT
# SNN index time: 0.2224433422088623
# SNN query time: 0.009207725524902344
# number of neighbors: 550
# indices of closest five: 0, 27279, 69983, 65906, 97095
```

Compare this to sklearn's KDTree:

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KDTree
st = time()
tree = KDTree(X)    
print("KDTree index time:", time()-st)
st = time()
ind2 = tree.query_radius(X[0].reshape(1, -1), radius)
print("KDTree query time:", time()-st)
print("number of neighbors:", len(ind2[0]))

# KDTree index time: 7.597502946853638
# KDTree query time: 0.08962678909301758
# number of neighbors: 550
```


We also support multi-point queries which exploit single-threaded BLAS-3 (multi-threading is under development):

```python
ind = snn_model.radius_batch_query(X[:10], radius) 
```

``snn_model.radius_batch_query`` uses Numba for further speedup. For the first run, Numba has to go through the code and optimize it, adding extra overhead. Each subsequent run of batch queries will be much faster.
